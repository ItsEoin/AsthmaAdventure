Asthma Adventure
================

Proof of concept iOS app and marketing website built for the Health Hack @ Dublin 2013 event. It's meant to help children with asthma problems, by making their routine more enjoyable with gamification concepts. Children can play games and unlock badges by scanning the QR codes on their inhalers, which we hope will help them build healthy routines and make their routine more enjoyable :)
